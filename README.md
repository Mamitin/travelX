# K.L.M.S. Travel

## Description
We built an app based on traveling. The user has access to dynamically generated weather cards. Also, the user can search new cities and generate a new weather card. Upon clicking on a card, the user will be scrolled down to the pictures and resturants sections where more information is displayed. Our site is a single page with three API calls.
